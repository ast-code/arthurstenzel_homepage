# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am Associate Professor of Accounting at the NHH - Norwegian School of Economics. My primary areas of interest are empirical research on financial regulation, corporate tax, and private markets. More specifically, I examine the measurement of tax avoidance, the influence of taxation on corporate innovation, and the real effects of financial accounting regulation. Other research interests include data analysis of non-financial data, e.g., textual and social media data, as well as business forecasting.
